    <p align="center">
        The motivation for this project is to create a weather dashboard that will show the current and future forecast of a selected city. I built this project because when an individual is planning to travel, it is important to know the weather forecast so they know what kind of clothes to bring. As a frequent traveler, it is so crucial to know whether I should be bringing heavier or lighter clothing and weather it will rain during my vacation. This is a platform users can use to prepare for their trips and access information easily. This project is a solution for users who want to feel prepared for their vacation and pack the correct type of clothing. Through this project, I learned how to connect and work with information in an API. It lets me know what is possible and what isn't possible, and most importantly how to fetch information.

## About the Project

This project is a weather dashboard. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery. Two different APIs were used in this project: Open Weather & Geo Code (both linked in credits). In this project, the main component is being able to check the current weather of a desired city as well as preview the 5-day future forecast of the weather. User will also have the ability to revisit their previously searched cities easily.

## Installation

Nothing is needed to install this project. It is deployed on pages through Gitlab and can be accessed online. If this is being used as a template or source code for refactoring, one can download the code or clone the source code to their own repository.

## Usage

In this project, a weather dashboard is built to help users retrieve the current and future forecast of a selected city. Users can search a city in the search box and the app should be able to search the coordinates needed for the weather API via the GeoCoding API. Once a city is searched, the app will generate the current forecast include information such as: city name, icon indicating weather forecast, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Additionally, it will also pull the information for the next 5 days as well and display it on the 5-day forecast section. Each searched city will be saved in the previously searched area so that users can access their history easily. When users re-visit the dashboard, they should see their previously searched cities populated there.

## Credits

This weather dashboard was built from scratch, however the design of the dashboard is derived from a sample that UofT Bootcamp provided. 

In addition to that, some websites that helped with the build of this code quiz includes:

- Event Listener MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener

The API's that are used in this project:
- Open Weather: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#example_JSON
- GeoCode: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#geocoding
